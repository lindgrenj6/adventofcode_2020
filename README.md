# AdventOfCode

### My solutions for advent of code 2020, in Elixir!

I'm basically putting input files in `input/`, and then throwing together a test as well in `test/`.

Common methods are in `lib/advent_of_code.ex` for things like reading a specified file, converting a list of strings -> ints etc. 

The solutions are in `lib/advent_of_code/` named for each day. I will update the unit tests pointing towards new input every time I solve a solution etc.

---

To validate, just run `mix test`.
